                        The game starts with all the cards face down and players take turns to turn over two
                        cards. <p></p>
                        The two cards have the same picture, then they keep the cards, otherwise they turn the cards
                        face
                        down again. <p></p>
                        The winner is the person with all the pairs found.
                        <p></p>This game was created by Joao Higino with the objective of entertaining my daughter Maria
                        and without any
                        commercial intention.
